These benchmarks are done to select the best approach for compilation.

The current best approach for each tests are:
- `users`: `partial inlining` - The fastest (both Node and Bun) and use the least amount of memory.
- `users2`: `partial inlining` - The fastest (both Node and Bun) and use the least amount of memory.

Run `bun data` in this directory to generate benchmark data.
